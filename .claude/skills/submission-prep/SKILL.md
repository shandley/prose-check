# Submission Preparation Guide

This guide covers preparing a manuscript for journal submission.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing cover letters
- Preparing figures and tables for submission
- Checking manuscript against requirements
- Resubmitting revised manuscripts

**Combine with:** `human-writing` for cover letter prose, `manuscript-writing` for structure.

## Pre-Submission Overview

### Required Components (Typical)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cover letter | Introduces manuscript to editor |
| Manuscript | Main text with all sections |
| Title page | Title, authors, affiliations, corresponding author |
| Abstract | Standalone summary |
| Figures | Each as separate high-resolution file |
| Tables | Often embedded or as separate files |
| Supplementary materials | Additional data, methods, figures |
| Author statements | Conflicts, contributions, ethics |

### Before You Start

1. **Identify target journal** - Match scope to your work
2. **Read author guidelines** - Every journal differs
3. **Check recent issues** - Understand what they publish
4. **Note specific requirements** - Word limits, figure formats, etc.

## Cover Letter Essentials

### Purpose
- Introduce your manuscript to the editor
- Explain why it fits the journal
- Highlight significance
- Address any special circumstances

### Key Elements
1. Editor's name (if known)
2. Manuscript title
3. Statement that work is original and not submitted elsewhere
4. Brief summary of findings and significance
5. Why this journal is appropriate
6. Any required statements (conflicts, prior posting, etc.)
7. Suggested/excluded reviewers (if requested)

### Cover Letter Length
- Keep to one page
- 3-4 paragraphs maximum
- Be specific but concise

See [COVER_LETTER_TEMPLATES.md](COVER_LETTER_TEMPLATES.md) for templates.

## Figure and Table Basics

### Figures

**Resolution requirements:**
| Type | Minimum | Preferred |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Line art | 600 DPI | 1200 DPI |
| Halftone (photos) | 300 DPI | 600 DPI |
| Combination | 600 DPI | 1200 DPI |

**Common formats:**
- TIFF (preferred for final submission)
- EPS (vector graphics)
- PDF (often accepted)
- JPEG (only for photos, maximum quality)

**Size guidelines:**
- Single column: ~85 mm (3.3 in)
- 1.5 column: ~114 mm (4.5 in)
- Double column: ~170 mm (6.7 in)

### Tables

**Best practices:**
- One table per concept
- Clear, descriptive title
- Column headers with units
- Footnotes for abbreviations and statistics
- No vertical lines (typically)
- Consistent decimal places

See [FIGURE_TABLE_GUIDELINES.md](FIGURE_TABLE_GUIDELINES.md) for detailed specifications.
