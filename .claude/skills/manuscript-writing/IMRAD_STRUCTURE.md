# IMRaD Structure Checklists

Detailed checklists for each section of a research manuscript.

## Introduction Checklist

### Content
- [ ] Opens with broad context establishing importance
- [ ] Reviews relevant literature (selective, not exhaustive)
- [ ] Identifies clear gap in knowledge
- [ ] States research question or hypothesis explicitly
- [ ] Briefly previews approach/methods
- [ ] Ends with specific objectives

### Flow
- [ ] Moves from general to specific (funnel structure)
- [ ] Each paragraph has clear purpose
- [ ] Logical transitions between paragraphs
- [ ] Gap statement connects background to objectives

### Common Issues to Check
- [ ] Not too long (10-15% of paper)
- [ ] Gap is clearly stated, not implied
- [ ] Objectives are specific and testable
- [ ] No results or conclusions appear here

## Methods Checklist

- [ ] Overall design stated (experimental, observational, etc.)
- [ ] Variables defined (independent, dependent, controls)
- [ ] Timeline/sequence described if relevant

### Participants/Samples
- [ ] Sample source and selection criteria
- [ ] Sample size and justification
- [ ] Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- [ ] Demographic or descriptive characteristics

### Procedures
- [ ] Step-by-step description of protocol
- [ ] Equipment/materials specified
- [ ] Software versions noted
- [ ] Established methods cited rather than re-described

### Data Analysis
- [ ] Statistical tests specified with rationale
- [ ] Software packages and versions listed
- [ ] Significance thresholds stated
- [ ] Handling of missing data described

### Ethics and Compliance
- [ ] Ethics approval mentioned (if applicable)
- [ ] Consent procedures described
- [ ] Data availability statement included

### Common Issues to Check
- [ ] Sufficient detail for replication
- [ ] Past tense throughout
- [ ] No results in this section
- [ ] Methods match what's reported in results

## Results Checklist

### Organization
- [ ] Logical order (by hypothesis, variable, or importance)
- [ ] Most important findings presented first
- [ ] Subsections match methods structure

### Reporting
- [ ] Effect sizes reported, not just p-values
- [ ] Confidence intervals included where appropriate
- [ ] Exact statistics provided (F, t, χ², df, p)
- [ ] Non-significant results also reported

### Figures and Tables
- [ ] All figures/tables referenced in text
- [ ] References appear before the figure/table in text
- [ ] Text describes key findings, doesn't duplicate table content
- [ ] Figure/table numbers are sequential

### Writing
- [ ] Results stated clearly without interpretation
- [ ] Past tense for specific findings
- [ ] Consistent significant figures throughout

### Common Issues to Check
- [ ] No interpretation (save for Discussion)
- [ ] No methods details (those belong in Methods)
- [ ] All analyses mentioned in Methods are reported
- [ ] Figures/tables are necessary, not redundant

## Discussion Checklist

### Structure
- [ ] Opens with brief restatement of key findings
- [ ] Interprets findings (doesn't just repeat)
- [ ] Connects to existing literature
- [ ] Addresses implications
- [ ] Acknowledges limitations honestly
- [ ] Suggests future directions
- [ ] Ends with clear conclusion

### Interpretation
- [ ] Explains what findings mean
- [ ] Addresses whether hypotheses were supported
- [ ] Considers alternative explanations
- [ ] Compares to previous studies

### Context
- [ ] Discusses agreement with prior work
- [ ] Addresses disagreement with prior work
- [ ] Explains discrepancies where possible

### Balance
- [ ] Claims match strength of evidence
- [ ] Limitations don't undermine entire study
- [ ] Speculation is clearly labeled
- [ ] Future directions are feasible

### Common Issues to Check
- [ ] Not just repeating results
- [ ] Not introducing new results
- [ ] Not overstating conclusions
- [ ] Not ignoring contradictory evidence

## Abstract Checklist

- [ ] Within word/character limit

- [ ] States main finding clearly
- [ ] Stands alone (no citations, abbreviations defined)
- [ ] No references to figures, tables, or sections
- [ ] Keywords/phrases for searchability
- [ ] Matches content of paper exactly

## Title Checklist

- [ ] Reflects main finding or topic
- [ ] Contains searchable keywords
- [ ] Within character/word limit
- [ ] No unnecessary abbreviations
- [ ] Accurate representation of content
- [ ] Appropriate style for target journal

## References Checklist
