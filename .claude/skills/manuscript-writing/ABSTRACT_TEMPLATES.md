## Structured Abstract (250 words)

### Template

**Background** (40-50 words)
[Context sentence establishing why this topic matters.] [What is known.] [What remains unknown or problematic.]

**Methods** (50-60 words)
[Study design and setting.] [Participants/samples and selection.] [Main procedures or interventions.] [Primary outcome measures.] [Analysis approach.]

**Results** (80-100 words)
[Sample characteristics if relevant.] [Primary outcome with effect size and significance.] [Secondary outcomes.] [Other key findings.]

**Conclusions** (40-50 words)
[Main take-home message.] [Implications for field/practice.] [Limitations or caveats if space permits.]

### Example (Structured)

**Background:** Species distribution models are widely used to predict range shifts under climate change, yet model transferability across time periods remains poorly understood. Previous validation studies have focused on single species or narrow geographic regions.

**Methods:** We compiled occurrence data for 847 North American bird species from 1970-2020. We fit ensemble species distribution models using historical climate data (1970-1990) and projected to recent conditions (2010-2020). Model performance was assessed using AUC and true skill statistic, with validation against independent survey data.

**Results:** Model transferability varied substantially across species (AUC range: 0.52-0.97). Migratory species showed significantly lower temporal transferability than residents (mean AUC 0.71 vs 0.84, p < 0.001). Range size was the strongest predictor of model performance (β = 0.34, p < 0.001). Models trained on broader climate ranges showed improved transferability.

**Conclusions:** Temporal transferability of species distribution models depends strongly on species traits. Predictions for migratory and range-restricted species should be interpreted with caution. Training models on climatically diverse occurrence data improves projection reliability.

## Unstructured Abstract (150 words)

### Template

[Opening sentence: why topic matters.] [What is known.] [Gap or problem.] [Study objective: "Here, we..." or "We investigated..."] [Brief methods: design, samples, approach.] [Key result 1 with statistic.] [Key result 2 if space permits.] [Conclusion: main implication or take-home message.]

### Example (Unstructured)

Accurate prediction of species range shifts is essential for conservation planning under climate change. While species distribution models are widely applied, their reliability when projected to novel time periods remains uncertain. We evaluated temporal transferability of ensemble distribution models for 847 North American bird species, training on 1970-1990 climate data and validating against 2010-2020 occurrences. Model performance varied widely across species (AUC: 0.52-0.97), with migratory species showing significantly lower transferability than residents (mean AUC 0.71 vs 0.84). Range size emerged as the strongest predictor of model success. These results indicate that distribution model projections should be interpreted cautiously for migratory and range-restricted species, and that training data spanning broad climatic conditions improves projection reliability.

## Abstract Writing Tips

### Do:
- Write the abstract last, after the paper is complete
- Include your main finding with a key statistic
- Use active voice where possible
- Make every word count
- Include keywords for searchability

### Don't:
- Include citations (unless journal requires)
- Reference figures, tables, or sections
- Use abbreviations (unless universally known)
- Include information not in the paper
- Use vague language ("various," "several")

### Quality Check:
- [ ] Stands completely alone
- [ ] Accurately represents paper content
- [ ] Contains searchable keywords
- [ ] Main finding is clear and specific
- [ ] Within word/character limit
- [ ] No first use of undefined abbreviations
