## Transitions to Avoid

These transitions are often overused or signal AI writing:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "It is important to note that" | State the point directly |
| "Interestingly," | State why it's interesting |
| "Notably," | Explain the significance |
| "Moreover," | Use "Also" or restructure |
| "Indeed," | Usually unnecessary |
| "In fact," | Usually unnecessary |
| "Thus," (overused) | "Therefore" or restructure |

## Tips for Smooth Transitions

1. **Echo key terms** - Repeat important words from previous paragraph
2. **Use demonstratives** - "This pattern," "These results," "Such findings"
3. **Be explicit** - Name what you're connecting to
4. **Vary structure** - Don't start every paragraph with a transition word
5. **Cut unnecessary transitions** - Sometimes direct statement is clearer
