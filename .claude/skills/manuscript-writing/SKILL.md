# Manuscript Writing Guide

This guide covers the structure and organization of academic research papers following the IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion).

## When to Use This Skill

- Starting a new research paper
- Organizing existing research into manuscript form
- Writing or revising specific sections
- Drafting abstracts and titles

**Combine with:** `human-writing` for prose style, `scientific-style` for citations and hedging.

## IMRaD Overview

| Section | Purpose | Tense | Typical Length |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|
| Title | Attract readers, convey main finding | N/A | 10-15 words |
| Abstract | Summarize entire paper | Mixed | 150-300 words |
| Introduction | Why this study matters | Present/Past | 10-15% |
| Methods | How study was done | Past | 15-20% |
| Results | What was found | Past | 25-30% |
| Discussion | What it means | Present/Past | 25-30% |

## Title Construction

Strong titles follow these patterns:

**Declarative** (states the finding):
- "Gene X regulates metabolic pathway Y in species Z"
- Best for clear, significant results

**Descriptive** (states the topic):
- "Regulation of metabolic pathway Y in species Z"
- Best when results are complex or exploratory

**Question** (poses the research question):
- "Does gene X regulate metabolic pathway Y?"
- Use sparingly; can seem uncertain

### Title Checklist
- [ ] Contains key terms for searchability
- [ ] Avoids abbreviations (except universally known ones)
- [ ] No colons unless necessary for subtitles
- [ ] Specific enough to distinguish from similar papers
- [ ] Accurate representation of content

## Section-by-Section Guidance

### Introduction

**Goal:** Move from broad context to specific research question.

**Structure (funnel shape):**
1. **Opening hook** - Why does this topic matter?
2. **Background** - What do we already know?
3. **Gap** - What remains unknown?
4. **Objective** - What does this study address?
5. **Approach** - How did you address it? (brief)

**Common mistakes:**
- Too much background, too little gap identification
- Burying the research question
- Citing exhaustively rather than selectively
- No clear statement of objectives

### Methods

**Goal:** Enable replication.

**Key principles:**
- Describe what you did, not why
- Use past tense throughout
- Include enough detail for replication
- Cite established protocols rather than re-describing

**Standard subsections:**
- Study design/overview
- Participants/samples
- Data collection/procedures
- Data analysis
- Ethics statement (if applicable)

### Results

**Goal:** Report findings without interpretation.

**Key principles:**
- Lead with most important findings
- State results, then reference supporting figure/table
- Report effect sizes, not just significance
- Present results systematically (by hypothesis, by variable, etc.)

**Structure each paragraph:**
1. Topic sentence stating the result
2. Supporting statistics
3. Reference to figure or table

### Discussion

**Goal:** Interpret findings and place in context.

**Structure:**
1. **Summary** - Restate key findings (1-2 sentences)
2. **Interpretation** - What do results mean?
3. **Context** - How do they fit existing literature?
4. **Implications** - Why do they matter?
5. **Limitations** - What are the caveats?
6. **Future directions** - What comes next?
7. **Conclusion** - Final take-home message

**Common mistakes:**
- Repeating results without interpretation
- Overstating conclusions
- Ignoring contradictory literature
- Limitations section that undermines the entire study

## Abstract Types

See [ABSTRACT_TEMPLATES.md](ABSTRACT_TEMPLATES.md) for templates.

**Structured abstract** (with headings):
- Background/Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions

**Unstructured abstract** (single paragraph):
- Same content, flowing prose
- Typically follows same order

## Key Transitions

See [SECTION_TRANSITIONS.md](SECTION_TRANSITIONS.md) for phrases to move between sections.

## Quality Checks

Before submission, verify each section:

- [ ] **Title** - Searchable, accurate, appropriate length
- [ ] **Abstract** - Stands alone, within word limit, no citations
- [ ] **Introduction** - Clear gap and objectives
- [ ] **Methods** - Replicable, complete, properly cited
- [ ] **Results** - Systematic, properly referenced figures/tables
- [ ] **Discussion** - Interprets (not repeats), acknowledges limitations
