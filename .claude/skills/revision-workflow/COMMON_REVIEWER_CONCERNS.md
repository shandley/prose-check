# Common Reviewer Concerns

Pre-written strategies and response frameworks for frequently raised issues.

## Sample Size Concerns

### "Sample size is too small"

**If you can justify:**
```
We acknowledge that our sample size (n = X) is modest. However, we note:
(1) our power analysis indicated this sample was sufficient to detect
[effect size] with [power level]; (2) our observed effect sizes were
[large/medium], consistent with adequate power; (3) this sample size
is comparable to similar studies in the field [citations]. We have
added text acknowledging sample size as a limitation.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z (power analysis details); Page A,
lines B-C (limitation).
```

**If you acknowledge weakness:**
```
We agree that sample size is a limitation of this study. [Explain why
larger sample was not possible: rare population, resource constraints,
etc.]. We have emphasized this limitation in the Discussion and have
tempered our conclusions accordingly. We also suggest replication with
larger samples as a future direction.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z (strengthened limitation); Page A,
lines B-C (tempered conclusions).
```

### "Need power analysis"

```
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added a power analysis
showing that with n = [X], α = [0.05], and observed effect size [d/r/etc.],
our study had [X]% power to detect the reported effects. [If retrospective:
"While post-hoc power analyses have limitations, this provides context
for interpreting our results."]

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

## Statistical Issues

### "Wrong statistical test"

**If you change the analysis:**
```
We thank the reviewer for this important feedback. We have re-analyzed
the data using [recommended method]. [Briefly explain why this is more
appropriate.] The results [remain consistent / have changed]. We have
updated the Methods and Results accordingly.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z (Methods); Page A, lines B-C (Results).
```

**If you justify original choice:**
```
We appreciate this suggestion. We used [original method] rather than
[suggested method] because [specific justification: data properties,
violations of assumptions, field conventions]. We have added text
explaining this rationale.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Report effect sizes, not just p-values"

```
We agree that effect sizes are essential for interpretation. We have
added [Cohen's d / r / η² / OR / etc.] with 95% confidence intervals
throughout the Results section.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z; [additional locations throughout Results].
```

### "Multiple comparisons need correction"

```
We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. We have applied
[Bonferroni / FDR / Holm / etc.] correction for multiple comparisons.
After correction, [results summary: which findings remain significant].
We have updated the Methods and Results accordingly.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z (Methods); Page A, lines B-C (Results).
```

---

## Generalizability Concerns

### "Results may not generalize beyond this sample"

```
We agree that generalizability is an important consideration. Our sample
was [describe characteristics], which may limit generalizability to
[broader population]. We have explicitly acknowledged this limitation
and identified specific populations to which our findings may/may not
apply.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Need replication in different population/context"

```
We agree that replication in [other population/context] would strengthen
these findings. We have added this as an important direction for future
research. The current study provides initial evidence that can guide
such replication efforts.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

---

## Missing Controls/Comparisons

### "Need control group"

**If you have one but didn't emphasize:**
```
We apologize for the confusion. Our study did include a control group
[describe]. We have clarified this in the Methods and Results sections.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z (Methods); Page A, lines B-C (Results).
```

**If you don't have one:**
```
We acknowledge that a [specific control] group would strengthen causal
inference. [Explain why not feasible: ethical concerns, practical
limitations, etc.]. We have acknowledged this limitation and discuss
how it affects interpretation of our findings.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Need additional comparison condition"

```
We appreciate this suggestion. [If feasible: "We have added analysis
comparing..." / If not feasible: "Unfortunately, this comparison is
not possible with our current data because [reason]. We have added
this as a future direction."]

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

---

## Methodological Concerns

### "Methods lack sufficient detail for replication"

```
We thank the reviewer for noting this. We have expanded the Methods
section to include [specific additions: equipment specifications,
step-by-step protocols, parameter settings, etc.]. The revised
Methods should now enable replication.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Need to validate measurement/instrument"

**If validation exists:**
```
We used [instrument/measure], which has been validated in [previous
studies, citations]. We have added this information and relevant
psychometric properties (e.g., Cronbach's α = X in our sample).

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

**If validation is limited:**
```
We acknowledge that [instrument/measure] has limited validation data.
We have added this as a limitation. [If you can add: "We have also
reported internal consistency in our sample (α = X)."]

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Potential confounds not addressed"

```
We thank the reviewer for identifying this potential confound. We have
[added it as a covariate / tested for its effects / discussed its
potential influence]. [Report results.] We have also acknowledged
[remaining limitations] in the Discussion.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

---

## Interpretation Concerns

### "Conclusions overstate findings"

```
We thank the reviewer for this feedback and agree that more cautious
language is warranted. We have tempered our conclusions and added
appropriate hedging language throughout the Discussion. We now frame
our findings as [new framing].

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z; [additional locations].
```

### "Alternative explanations not considered"

```
We appreciate the reviewer raising this alternative interpretation.
We have added discussion of [alternative explanation] and explain
why we believe [our interpretation / the alternative / both] may
apply. [If testable: "We have also added analysis that bears on this
question."]

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Correlation does not imply causation"

```
We agree and did not intend to imply causation. We have revised the
text to use language that clearly indicates correlational rather than
causal relationships (e.g., "associated with" rather than "leads to").

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z; [additional locations].
```

---

## Literature Concerns

### "Relevant literature not cited"

```
We thank the reviewer for bringing this work to our attention. We have
added [citations] and discuss their relevance to our findings in the
[Introduction/Discussion].

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Literature review is outdated"

```
We appreciate this feedback. We have updated our literature review to
include recent publications through [date], including [key recent
studies]. This provides more current context for our work.

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

### "Findings contradict [study] without acknowledgment"

```
We thank the reviewer for noting this discrepancy. We have added
discussion of [study] and potential explanations for the different
findings, including [methodological differences / population differences /
measurement differences / etc.].

Changes made: Page X, lines Y-Z.
```

---

## Writing/Presentation Concerns

### "Paper is too long"

```
We have reduced the manuscript length by [X words/pages]. Key reductions
include [condensed background, moved details to supplement, streamlined
discussion, etc.]. The core content and arguments remain intact.

Changes made: Throughout; net reduction of X words.
```

### "Figures/tables are difficult to read"

```
We have revised [Figure X / Table Y] to improve readability. Changes
include [larger font, clearer labels, better color contrast, simplified
layout, etc.]. We hope the revised version is clearer.

Changes made: Figure X / Table Y.
```

### "Writing needs improvement"

```
We have carefully revised the manuscript for clarity and readability.
[Specific improvements: simplified sentence structure, corrected errors,
improved flow, etc.]. We have also [had it professionally edited /
had a native English speaker review it / etc.].

Changes made: Throughout the manuscript.
