# Revision Workflow Guide

This guide covers responding to peer review and managing the revision process.

## When to Use This Skill

- Drafting response letters to reviewers
- Organizing and tracking manuscript changes
- Addressing specific reviewer concerns
- Planning revision strategy

**Combine with:** `scientific-style` for appropriate hedging, `human-writing` for clear prose.

## Response Strategies by Comment Type

| Comment Type | Strategy |
|--------------|----------|
| Minor correction | Thank, agree, fix, cite location |
| Clarification request | Thank, explain, add text if needed |
| Additional analysis | Agree if feasible, explain if not, provide results |
| Methodological concern | Address directly, explain rationale, add detail |
| Interpretation disagreement | Acknowledge perspective, explain reasoning, modify if warranted |
| Literature gap | Thank, add citations, discuss relevance |
| Impossible request | Explain why, offer alternative |

## Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Thank reviewers for specific suggestions
- Acknowledge valid concerns directly
- Explain your reasoning clearly
- Be professional and respectful
- Separate agreement from action (you can agree something is unclear without agreeing with the proposed fix)

### Don't:
- Be defensive or argumentative
- Dismiss concerns without explanation
- Over-apologize or be obsequious
- Make promises you can't keep
- Ignore any comment (respond to everything)

### Language Calibration

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "The reviewer is wrong" | "We respectfully disagree because..." |
| "We already said this" | "We have clarified this point by..." |
| "This is beyond scope" | "While this is an important question, it is beyond the scope of the current study because..." |
| "We can't do this" | "Unfortunately, [reason]. As an alternative, we have..." |
