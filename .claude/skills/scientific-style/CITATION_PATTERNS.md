# Citation Patterns

Detailed guidance on integrating citations into scientific writing.

## Integral vs. Non-Integral Citations

### Integral Citations

The author is part of the sentence structure.

**Common patterns:**

```
Subject position:
- Smith (2023) found that X increased with Y.
- According to Johnson et al. (2024), the effect was significant.
- As demonstrated by Lee (2022), temperature affects the rate.

With reporting verb:
- Wang and Chen (2023) argued that the model was incomplete.
- Previous authors (Brown 2021; Davis 2022) have suggested...
```

**Use integral citations when:**
- The author's identity matters (famous researcher, competing lab)
- Comparing different researchers' positions
- Discussing methodology specific to a study
- Attributing a controversial or novel claim

### Non-Integral Citations

The citation is parenthetical; information is emphasized.

**Common patterns:**

```
End of clause:
- Expression levels vary across tissues (Smith 2023).
- This relationship has been documented previously (Lee 2022; Chen 2023).

Mid-sentence (with specific data):
- The rate constant (k = 2.3 s⁻¹; Johnson 2024) was consistent with...
```

**Use non-integral citations when:**
- The information is more important than who said it
- Citing multiple sources for the same point
- Stating widely accepted facts
- Avoiding repetitive "X found that" structures

## Reporting Verbs by Category

| observe | Direct observation | "We observed similar patterns..." |
| identify | Naming/discovering | "Lee (2024) identified three factors..." |
| document | Recording evidence | "This effect is well documented (...)." |

### Evidence-Strength Verbs

| Verb | Strength | Use When |
|------|----------|----------|
| prove | Very strong | Mathematical proofs, logical necessity only |
| demonstrate | Strong | Clear experimental evidence |
| show | Strong | Solid empirical support |
| establish | Strong | Foundational, accepted findings |
| confirm | Moderate-strong | Replicating previous findings |
| support | Moderate | Evidence consistent with claim |
| suggest | Tentative | Preliminary or indirect evidence |
| indicate | Tentative | Points toward conclusion |
| imply | Tentative | Indirect inference |

### Stance/Position Verbs

| Verb | Connotation | Use When |
|------|-------------|----------|
| argue | Presenting a position | Theoretical or interpretive claims |
| claim | Slight skepticism | You may not fully agree |
| assert | Confident statement | Strong position by author |
| contend | Debatable position | Contested claim |
| propose | Theoretical | New model or hypothesis |
| hypothesize | Speculative | Untested prediction |
| speculate | Very tentative | Beyond data |

### Method/Action Verbs

| Verb | Usage | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| measure | Quantification | "Smith (2023) measured the rate..." |
| analyze | Data analysis | "We analyzed the data using..." |
| test | Hypothesis testing | "Johnson (2024) tested whether..." |
| examine | Investigation | "Previous work examined this relationship..." |
| investigate | Research | "Several studies have investigated..." |
| compare | Comparison | "Lee (2022) compared three methods..." |
| evaluate | Assessment | "We evaluated the performance of..." |

## Citation Placement

### End of Sentence

Most common position. Citation supports the entire statement.

```
Temperature significantly affects reaction rate (Smith 2023).
```

### End of Clause

Citation supports specific part of a compound sentence.

```
While temperature affects rate (Smith 2023), pressure has minimal effect (Lee 2024).
```

### After Specific Information

Citation supports a particular fact or number.

```
The mutation rate (1.2 × 10⁻⁸ per base pair; Johnson 2024) was consistent with...
```

### Multiple Citations

**For different aspects:**
```
Previous work has examined both structure (Smith 2022) and function (Lee 2023).
```

**For supporting evidence:**
```
This effect has been widely documented (Brown 2021; Chen 2022; Davis 2023).
```

**Ordering multiple citations:**
- Chronological: (Smith 2021; Lee 2022; Chen 2023)
- Alphabetical: (Brown 2022; Johnson 2023; Smith 2021)
- By relevance: Most relevant first
- Check journal style guide for preference

## Avoiding Citation Problems

### Problem: Orphan Citations

Citation without context or integration.

**Bad:**
```
Gene expression varies with temperature. Smith (2023). We therefore...
```

**Good:**
```
Gene expression varies with temperature (Smith 2023). We therefore...
```

### Problem: Citation Stacking

Too many citations for one claim.

**Bad:**
```
Temperature affects enzyme activity (Smith 2021; Lee 2021; Chen 2022;
Brown 2022; Davis 2023; Johnson 2023; Wang 2024; Miller 2024).
```

**Better:**
```
Temperature affects enzyme activity (reviewed in Smith 2023).
```

Or:
```
Temperature affects enzyme activity (e.g., Smith 2021; Lee 2022).
```

### Problem: Vague Attribution

Citation doesn't clearly support the claim.

**Bad:**
```
Climate change is accelerating (Smith 2023).
[If Smith 2023 is about something tangentially related]
```

**Good:**
```
Global temperatures have increased 1.1°C since pre-industrial times (IPCC 2023).
```

### Problem: Outdated Citations

Over-reliance on old sources when current ones exist.

**Check:**
- Is this the most recent consensus?
- Has this finding been updated or contradicted?
- Are there more recent reviews?

### Problem: Missing Primary Sources

Citing secondary sources instead of originals.

**Better practice:**
- Cite primary source when available
- Use "as cited in" only when primary is inaccessible
- Cite reviews for general claims, primaries for specifics

## Citation in Different Sections

### Introduction

- Establish context with seminal works
- Use mix of integral (for key contributors) and non-integral
- Cite recent reviews for broad claims
- Be selective, not exhaustive

### Methods

- Cite established protocols
- Cite software/tools with versions
- Usually non-integral: "We used X method (Smith 2023)"
- Cite validation studies for assays/instruments

### Results

- Minimal citations typically
- Cite only if comparing to specific previous findings
- "Consistent with previous reports (Lee 2023),..."

### Discussion

- Heavy citation use
- Compare your findings to others (integral)
- Support interpretations (non-integral)
- Address contradictions explicitly

## Self-Citation

**Appropriate:**
- Building on your previous work
- Methodology from your prior publication
- Avoiding self-plagiarism by citing rather than repeating

**Inappropriate:**
- Excessive self-promotion
- Padding citation counts
- When better/more relevant citations exist

**Balance:** Cite yourself when genuinely relevant; don't force it.
