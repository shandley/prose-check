## Structural Patterns

Beyond word choice, AI writing has distinctive structural patterns.

### Sentence Length Distribution

| Metric | AI | Human | Insight |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| Mean length | 23.9 words | 19.8 words | AI sentences slightly longer |
| Coefficient of variation | 137.1% | 70.5% | AI has more extreme variation |
| Short sentences (1-10 words) | 39.9% | 23.9% | AI uses more short sentences |
| Medium sentences (11-25 words) | 34.1% | 50.3% | Human writing more consistent |
| Long sentences (26+ words) | 26.1% | 25.8% | Similar long sentence usage |

*Tip: AI tends to alternate between very short and very long sentences. Human writing has more medium-length sentences.*

### Passive Voice

- AI uses passive voice in **4.7%** of sentences
- Human writing uses passive voice in **14.9%** of sentences
- *Surprisingly, AI uses LESS passive voice than humans. Don't over-correct by avoiding all passive constructions.*

### Paragraph Structure

- AI average: **16.2 words** per paragraph
- AI uses **18.4 paragraphs** per document on average

*Tip: AI tends to fragment text into many short paragraphs. Consider combining related ideas into longer, more developed paragraphs.*

### List Usage

- AI uses **9.5** list items per response on average
- Human writing uses **0.0** list items per text on average
- *Tip: You might be over-using bullet points. Consider prose instead.*

### Punctuation

| Punctuation | AI (per 1k chars) | Human (per 1k chars) | Ratio |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| em dash | 4.79 | 0.28 | 16.9x |
| colon | 4.12 | 1.01 | 4.1x |
| semicolon | 0.69 | 0.23 | 3.1x |

*Tip: Em dashes are a strong AI signal. Replace with commas, periods, or parentheses.*

## Before/After Examples

Here's how to rewrite AI-sounding text to sound more natural:

**Before (AI-like):**
> It's important to note that this approach has several crucial advantages. Additionally, it facilitates seamless integration.

**After (more natural):**
> This approach has several key advantages. It also makes integration easier.

---

**Before (AI-like):**
> Let's delve into the intricacies of this multifaceted problem. Furthermore, we should leverage existing solutions.

**After (more natural):**
> Let's look at this complex problem. We should also use existing solutions.

---

**Before (AI-like):**
> In order to achieve optimal results, it is essential that you utilize the comprehensive documentation.

**After (more natural):**
> To get the best results, use the full documentation.

---

**Before (AI-like):**
> That being said, the aforementioned methodology provides a robust framework for addressing these challenges.

**After (more natural):**
> Still, this method gives you a solid framework for these challenges.

---

**Before (AI-like):**
> Ultimately, at its core, this represents a pivotal shift in the landscape of software development.

**After (more natural):**
> This is a major shift in software development.

## Methodology

This styleguide was generated by:

1. Generating 200 text samples from Claude Opus 4.5
2. Collecting 6000 human-written texts from Wikipedia, OpenWebText, and other sources
3. Comparing word frequencies, phrase patterns, and structural features
4. Identifying patterns where AI usage is statistically significantly higher (p < 0.01) and at least 2x more frequent

The log-odds ratio measures how much more likely a pattern is in AI text vs human text. Higher values = more distinctively AI.
